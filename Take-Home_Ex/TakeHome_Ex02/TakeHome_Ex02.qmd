Remaking peer\'s original design by improving chart\'s clarity and aesthetics and creating an alternative design if needed.

# 1. Overview

In this Take-home Exercise 2, I have chosen one of my peer's Take-home Exercise 1 tableau submissions and analysed the charts in terms of clarify and aesthetics. In the same time, I also used R to remake the original design by using data visualisation principles and best practices learnt in previous two classes.

# 2.Critique 

## 2.1 Original Design

The original design is shown below:

As we all known, the task of Take-home exercise 1 is to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. The above design showed the demographic structure successfully. Yet, this design can be improved in terms of following criteria.

## 2.2 Clarity

### (a) Graph Title

The graph title can deliver the information clearly. But I think it is a bit too long. Maybe can be shorter. For example, can name it as SG Age-Sex Population Pyramids. We don't need to say again we choose nine area because we showed nine pyramids.

## (b) Axes Labeling

The design did not add the axes labels. It would bring some misunderstanding about the data. So I think we can add the "Age" on the left side and the "Population" on the bottom side. It also added the gender labels on the bottom side and I think it's good because it can bring a clear information about the gender differences.

For every pyramid, it has been added the area name label, which is very clear to show the specific area's situation.

## 2.3 Aesthetics

### (a) Alignment- Graph Title

In my opinion, the title aligning the pyramid area would be better than aligning the left side of the view.

### (b) The texts of population amount

When you point to one of the pyramids, it would show the amount of population automatically. So I think the text of the number can be removed.

### (c) The display sequence of pyramids

The take-home exercise 1 requires us to display the nine pyramids on one view by using trellis display but this design needs us to use the scrolling bar to see the whole view. It's not really fit for the requirement.

3. Using R to improve the original visualisation

## 3.1 Step by step description

1\) Installing and loading R packages. Three packages will be installed and loaded. They are : ggiraph, tidyverse and readxl.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggiraph,tidyverse,readxl)
```

2\) Importing data. Data import was accomplished using *read_csv()* of the **readr** package.

```{r}
pop <- read_csv("data/respopagesextod2022.csv")
```

3\) Read the head data:

```{r}
head(pop)
```

4\) First, we need to calculate the frequency count of the total population in Singapore by gender(Sex), age(AG), and planning area(PA). In the code chunk, we can use *group_by()* to group the orders by age, gender, and planning area. Afrer that, we can use summarise() of dplyr package to compute the amount of residents.

```{r}
freq_pop <- pop %>%
  group_by(`AG`, `Sex`,`PA`) %>%
  summarise('Count'= sum(`Pop`)) %>%
  ungroup()
head(freq_pop)
```

5\) We need to sort the data based on the categorical age group assigned in the original dataset. We can use *mutate()* to change the order and then use arrange() of dplyr package to sort. And then display the hold table.

```{r}
order <- c("0_to_4", "5_to_9", "10_to_14", "15_to_19", "20_to_24", "25_to_29", "30_to_34", "35_to_39", "40_to_44", "45_to_49", "50_to_54", "55_to_59", "60_to_64", "65_to_69", "70_to_74", "75_to_79", "80_to_84", "85_to_89", "90_and_over")

sorted_pop <- freq_pop %>%
  mutate(AG =  factor(AG, levels = order)) %>%
  arrange(AG)
  
sorted_pop

```

6\) Because the take-home exercise needs us to choose nine planning area. So, base on the original design, I choose

```{r}
PA_sorted_pop <- filter(sorted_pop,PA %in% c("Ang Mo Kio","Bukit Merah","Bukit Timah","Hougang","Jurong East","Kallang","Pasir Ris","Sengkang","Toa Payoh"))
PA_sorted_pop
```

# **3.2.3 绘制年龄-性别人口金字塔**

#### **静态年龄性别人口金字塔**

使用**ggplot2**绘制了年龄-性别人口金字塔，如下所示：

-   *geom_col()*而不是*geom_bar()*用于创建条形图，因为我们不需要修改数据，并且希望条形的长度代表实际的人口统计数据。

-   *Base R 函数的ifelse()*将 Male 居民的人口数转换为负数，以便他们的数据将绘制在金字塔的左侧。

-   *scale_x\_continuous()*用于修改 x 轴上的标签以提供更好的可读性。

    ```{r}
    p <- ggplot(PA_sorted_pop, aes(x = ifelse(Sex == "Males", yes = -Count, no = Count), 
                              y = AG, fill = Sex)) + 
      geom_col() +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-150000, 150000, 50000), 
                         labels = paste0(as.character(c(seq(150, 0, -50), seq(50, 150, 50))),"k")) +
      labs (x = "Population", y = "Age", title='Singapore Age-Sex Population Pyramid 2021') +
      theme_bw() +
      theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
      scale_fill_manual(values = c("Males" = "lightblue", "Females" = "lightpink"))+
      facet_wrap(~ PA)
    p
    ```

```{r}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p,session="knitr")
```

```{}
```
