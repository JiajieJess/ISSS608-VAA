    "text": "3.1 Step by step description\n1) Installing and loading R packages. Three packages will be installed and loaded. They are : ggiraph, tidyverse and readxl.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph,tidyverse,readxl)\n\n2) Importing data. Data import was accomplished using read_csv() of the readr package.\n\npop <- read_csv(\"data/respopagesextod2022.csv\")\n\n3) Read the head data:\n\nhead(pop)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  PA         SZ                     AG     Sex   TOD                   Pop  Time\n  <chr>      <chr>                  <chr>  <chr> <chr>               <dbl> <dbl>\n1 Ang Mo Kio Ang Mo Kio Town Centre 0_to_4 Males HDB 1- and 2-Room …     0  2022\n2 Ang Mo Kio Ang Mo Kio Town Centre 0_to_4 Males HDB 3-Room Flats       10  2022\n3 Ang Mo Kio Ang Mo Kio Town Centre 0_to_4 Males HDB 4-Room Flats       10  2022\n4 Ang Mo Kio Ang Mo Kio Town Centre 0_to_4 Males HDB 5-Room and Exe…    30  2022\n5 Ang Mo Kio Ang Mo Kio Town Centre 0_to_4 Males HUDC Flats (exclud…     0  2022\n6 Ang Mo Kio Ang Mo Kio Town Centre 0_to_4 Males Condominiums and O…    50  2022\n\n\n4) First, we need to calculate the frequency count of the total population in Singapore by gender(Sex), age(AG), and planning area(PA). In the code chunk, we can use group_by() to group the orders by age, gender, and planning area. Afrer that, we can use summarise() of dplyr package to compute the amount of residents.\n\nfreq_pop <- pop %>%\n  group_by(`AG`, `Sex`,`PA`) %>%\n  summarise('Count'= sum(`Pop`)) %>%\n  ungroup()\nhead(freq_pop)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  AG     Sex     PA          Count\n  <chr>  <chr>   <chr>       <dbl>\n1 0_to_4 Females Ang Mo Kio   2480\n2 0_to_4 Females Bedok        4970\n3 0_to_4 Females Bishan       1320\n4 0_to_4 Females Boon Lay        0\n5 0_to_4 Females Bukit Batok  4400\n6 0_to_4 Females Bukit Merah  2800\n\n\n5) We need to sort the data based on the categorical age group assigned in the original dataset. We can use mutate() to change the order and then use arrange() of dplyr package to sort. And then display the hold table.\n\norder <- c(\"0_to_4\", \"5_to_9\", \"10_to_14\", \"15_to_19\", \"20_to_24\", \"25_to_29\", \"30_to_34\", \"35_to_39\", \"40_to_44\", \"45_to_49\", \"50_to_54\", \"55_to_59\", \"60_to_64\", \"65_to_69\", \"70_to_74\", \"75_to_79\", \"80_to_84\", \"85_to_89\", \"90_and_over\")\n\nsorted_pop <- freq_pop %>%\n  mutate(AG =  factor(AG, levels = order)) %>%\n  arrange(AG)\n  \nsorted_pop\n\n# A tibble: 2,090 × 4\n   AG     Sex     PA                      Count\n   <fct>  <chr>   <chr>                   <dbl>\n 1 0_to_4 Females Ang Mo Kio               2480\n 2 0_to_4 Females Bedok                    4970\n 3 0_to_4 Females Bishan                   1320\n 4 0_to_4 Females Boon Lay                    0\n 5 0_to_4 Females Bukit Batok              4400\n 6 0_to_4 Females Bukit Merah              2800\n 7 0_to_4 Females Bukit Panjang            2730\n 8 0_to_4 Females Bukit Timah              1750\n 9 0_to_4 Females Central Water Catchment     0\n10 0_to_4 Females Changi                     60\n# … with 2,080 more rows\n\n\n6) Because the take-home exercise needs us to choose nine planning areas. So, base on the original design, I choose “Ang Mo Kio”, “Bukit Merah”, “Bukit Timah”, “Hougang”, “Jurong East”, “Kallang”, “Pasir Ris”, “Sengkang”, “Toa Payoh” nine planning areas. And then display the whole table of nine planning areas.\n\nPA_sorted_pop <- filter(sorted_pop,PA %in% c(\"Ang Mo Kio\",\"Bukit Merah\",\"Bukit Timah\",\"Hougang\",\"Jurong East\",\"Kallang\",\"Pasir Ris\",\"Sengkang\",\"Toa Payoh\"))\nPA_sorted_pop\n\n# A tibble: 342 × 4\n   AG     Sex     PA          Count\n   <fct>  <chr>   <chr>       <dbl>\n 1 0_to_4 Females Ang Mo Kio   2480\n 2 0_to_4 Females Bukit Merah  2800\n 3 0_to_4 Females Bukit Timah  1750\n 4 0_to_4 Females Hougang      4430\n 5 0_to_4 Females Jurong East  1130\n 6 0_to_4 Females Kallang      1810\n 7 0_to_4 Females Pasir Ris    2730\n 8 0_to_4 Females Sengkang     6900\n 9 0_to_4 Females Toa Payoh    2550\n10 0_to_4 Males   Ang Mo Kio   2530\n# … with 332 more rows"
